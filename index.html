           <h1 style="border: 90 solid tomato;"> <p> <strong>Web Development vs. Web Programming
                Web development and web programming sound very similar — and they are. But there’s one very important distinction. 
                
                Web development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web applications, including the project’s design, layout, coding, content creation, and functionality. It involves using a combination of programming languages, tools, and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life. It may also encompass project management activities, such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or freelance clients. 
                
                Web programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the coding and scripting of a website, whether the front-end or back-end. It primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and generate dynamic content. A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a web development project from end to end. They may build a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs.
                
                Understanding this difference has been crucial in my career, allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth of skills required in the world of web creation. It's a reminder of the diverse talents and expertise that come together to make the digital world what it is today. </strong></p></h1>

                web development, you might start out writing a simple page of HTML text and build up to creating more

    <p>The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:

        <em> Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.
            Development: It refers to building the application from scratch.
            Web Development can be classified into two ways: </em>

        <strong> Frontend Development </strong>
        <strong> Backend Development </strong>
        <strong>Frontend Development </strong>
        The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the
        ‘client side’ of the application.
